/*  Overview

You will be designing a console application to manage a client’s bank account.For now, the application will have only one client that is hard-coded into the system.
The client has one checking account and one savings account.

In the menu, after a user selects either View Balance, Deposit, or Withdraw, the program should then give the option of selecting which account.


 After each transaction, the current balance should be displayed on the screen.
 Your program should include:
 1 abstract method(at least)
 1 virtual method(at least)
 1 override method(at least)


When a user launches the program the following menu should be displayed to the screen.

1. View Client Information
2. View Account Balance
3. Deposit Funds
4. Withdraw Funds
5. Exit
If the user wants to view account balance, deposit funds, or withdraw money, the user should be prompted to select which account.
Be sure the user can continue making selections from the menu until all desired transactions have been completed.

Stretch Tasks
Right now this program is designed for one user. Giving the ability to enter a user name when the program begins would make the program useful for multiple users. 
At this point do not worry about trying to add passwords.That is outside of the scope of what we know at this point.
Letting the users log in with only their names is less secure, but we're focused on functionality right now.

Hints
Persistence is not required. Meaning each time you run the program all of the values can reset.
You can choose any starting balance to begin the program.
Think about what data type should be used for dealing with money. */
